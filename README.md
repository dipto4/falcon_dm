### Falcon-DM
Lightweight N-body code written in C++, specifically tuned for simulations of Intermediate Mass Ratio Inspirals (IMRIs) embedded in dark matter (DM) spikes.

Features:
1. 2nd order DKD integrator using HOLD scheme
2. Symmetrized, individual, time-steps
3. Post-Newtonian (PN) effects upto PN2.5 using the Auxiliary Velocity Algorithm

If you use this code, please cite Mukherjee et al. (2024)
